				We developed the website for the management of books in the library by the robot. The designing of robot is an ongoing process. The book need to be looked by any user through the app. If they find the book in the library they visit the library and ask the robot to bring it for him/her. After geting the instruction from our website placed in the library the robot moves and gets the book.
